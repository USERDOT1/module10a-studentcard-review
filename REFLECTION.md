# Module 10A – StudentCard Code Review

## Description
This is a React code review assignment. I reviewed the StudentCard component and added comments to explain the logic behind props, state, and interactivity. The code was missing an import statement but the code other than that was really concise and cool.

## What I Learned
- How to use and identify props and state
- How toggle functionality works with useState
- How to better document and explain React components
- How certain components can be toggled on and off with a bool in react.
